This is the first version of my closet app, made for a class. It was my first experience writing in Kotlin and using Android Studio.
The idea of the app is to have a digital closet where you can upload your clothing items, sort, and do other various things to make managing your clothes easier.
I'm uploading this version as legacy, as I want to redo the app with an actual functional database, as well as useful features like actual sorting, or the ability to upload pictures.
